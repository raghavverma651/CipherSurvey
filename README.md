Parallelizing CiphersParallelizing Ciphers
In the current software development industry, ciphers keep on growing in temporal and spatial size in terms of implementations due to the constant paranoia of breaking the security of these ciphers. Our approaches to creating ciphers have moreso taken the form of being more complex and bigger in size than ever and therefore the need for efficiency of these ciphers is of the hour. It is important to keep both efficiency and durability of ciphers while creating them completely anew. Therefore, in this comparative study, we shall examine various approaches to parallelizing ciphers in the languages of C++, a nearly bare-metal language, and Python as a contrasting versatile language to understand and conclude a series of best practices on parallelizing cipher encryption/decryption to apply in general cryptographic implementations. We shall implement various libraries such as OpenMP (a representative for a threading-based implementation) and Joblibs (a representative for a multiprocessing-based implementation) over various kinds of ciphers in an attempt to generalize a series of best practices in parallelization. Our scope of generalization will not be absolute and will merely serve as a set of guiding principles while creating ciphers in the future for the sake of durable security. The contribution will be in terms of the evaluated best practices while attempting to parallelise ciphers using multiple techniques, which would help establish a baseline standard for faster ciphers in general.
